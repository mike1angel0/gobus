# Phase 5: Feature Completeness — Profile, Admin Panel, Provider Analytics, Driver Passengers

**Status**: Pending
**Dependencies**: FE Phase 4 (driver, admin fleet, hardening), BE Phase 4 (all endpoints already implemented)
**Goal**: Implement all remaining frontend pages and hooks to achieve 100% endpoint coverage against the OpenAPI spec. This includes user profile management, full admin panel (users, audit logs), provider profile and analytics, driver passenger manifest, and navbar updates for all new pages.

## Quality Gates

### TASK-010: Phase 5 quality gates and coverage

Run all quality gates and fix any issues introduced by Phase 5.

- [ ] `npm run typecheck` — zero errors
- [ ] `npm run lint` — zero errors (warnings acceptable for known react-hooks/incompatible-library)
- [ ] `npm run format:check` — passes (run `format:fix` if needed)
- [ ] `npm run test` — all tests pass
- [ ] `npm run test:coverage` — meets 90% threshold (statements, branches, functions, lines)
- [ ] `npm run build` — production build succeeds
- [ ] `npm run api:check` — all frontend API calls reference valid spec endpoints, coverage improved
- [ ] Zero `any` types in new code
- [ ] Zero `console.log` in new code
- [ ] Zero raw `fetch()` calls — all API calls through typed client
- [ ] JSDoc on all new exports
- [ ] All new pages have loading skeletons, error states with retry, empty states
- [ ] All new forms use Zod schemas matching OpenAPI spec constraints
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA: semantic HTML, aria-labels on interactive elements, keyboard navigable
- [ ] Verify endpoint coverage: `api:check` should report ≥95% spec endpoint coverage (up from ~87%)

---

## Pre-existing Issues (Fix Before or During Phase 5)

### TASK-011: Fix pre-existing quality gate failures

Address existing failures that block clean quality gates.

- [ ] Fix `apps/web/src/components/fleet/seat-map-editor.test.tsx` — remove unused `beforeEach` import and `SeatType` type (already fixed, verify committed)
- [ ] Run `npm run format:fix` in apps/web to fix 28 files with formatting issues
- [ ] Fix frontend coverage to meet 90% threshold:
  - Branch coverage 82.89% → needs improvement in provider/routes.tsx, provider/schedules.tsx, driver/trip-detail.tsx, auth-context.tsx (see Phase 4 QA items US-QA-002 through US-QA-007)
  - Function coverage 89.55% → add tests for uncovered functions in fleet.tsx, trip-detail.tsx
  - Statement coverage 89.88% → follows from branch/function fixes
